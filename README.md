# MyApp

This was my first foray into using Angular as a front-end framework for web-design. The application is very simple, and requires the user to enter in the input forms information they wish to save as a diary entry (a title, date and content) and saves it within the diary entry list by pressing the add entry button.

This was just over 2 hours worth of work (which included a time for me to install Angular and grasp the use of basic commands to generate the front end and its use with Typescript). I would have much liked to continue to add in a search funtion, a minimising function for the content text for longer diary entries to create a more brief entry list, better input functionality so that a user can see everything they are typing, as well as ultimately using a database to actually store data permanently. I did not use Git version control but did use source control via visual studio, and using Git is something I will switch to for this project after the submission. 

I did also have a problem with my laptop where strangely my Executables for scripts were Restricted within Windows and had to spend 5 minutes changing my executables permissions on my current user and local machine. 


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
